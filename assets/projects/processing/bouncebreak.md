### Bouncebreak

Inspired by games like [BB-TAN for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bbtan-by-111/id1060433597?mt=8), but for the browser.

After clicking the 'Play Game' button, click, hold and drag your mouse (on the gray area) and release to shoot a ball.

Hitting squares will reduce their number by 1, and hitting circles will give you another ball!
