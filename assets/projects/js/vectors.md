### Black Holes

The first ever computer visual that really captured my attention was the old Windows screensaver where the logo bounces around the screen. Naturally, I wanted to recreate that, and, naturally, I wasn't happy with the initial result of a single circle just moving about.

So what did I do? What every sane person would do: I added *more stuff* and made some *freakin' black holes* that you can put wherever you want.

**Controls:**

*Click* to create a black hole

***(click on the gear in the top right)***

*Pull, Push and Twist* are the three black hole modes

*Reset* re-runs the program

*Freeze* freezes the scene

*Infinity* causes black holes to stay forever; they never shrink or die
