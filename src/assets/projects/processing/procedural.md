### Procedural Art

The first two things I learned about Processing were how to generate a random number and how to draw a circle - here's the result.

**Buttons**

***Run*** generates the art.

***Wipe*** clears the canvas.

***This Frame Only*** wipes every new frame, showing only the most recent frame.

***?*** shows available algorithms; the keys they correspond with (*1, 2, 3...*) switch the algorithm.

Try switching algorithms mid-run for an awesome effect!
