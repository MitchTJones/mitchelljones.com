When I took my first ever Programming class, I spent weeks working on this project and never ended up succeeding.

Now that I'm a bit more experienced, I've gone back to that pesky original project and made my first Processing game.

**In Menu**

Click on a player to deactivate it (Ex. *click on 'Player 3' and 'Player 4' to play with only 2 players*)

Click on a color below your player to choose that color

**In Game**

Your controls are now shown next to your player (Ex. *for Player 2, W is up, A is left, S is down, D is right*) Hit one of your controls to ready up.

Running into another player's tail (smaller squares) will kill you. It's like [LightBike](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightbike-2/id373778227?mt=8) meets Snake
