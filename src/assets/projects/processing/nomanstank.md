### No Man's Tank

This was my first attempt at basic procedural generation, hence the name parody of <a href='https://www.nomanssky.com/'>No Man's Sky</a>

Click, hold and drag your mouse (on the gray area) and release to shoot a bomb into the air.

Hold the left and right arrow keys to move. *There was a **lot** of Trigonometry involved in getting it to move, shoot and collide right*

Hitting squares will reduce their number by 1, and hitting circles will give you another ball!
