### Low Poly

Click [here]() (work in progress) to make your own visual!

The 'low-poly' style has always been my favorite visual art style. For my game, [Battle Blocks](/projects/dsgame/intro), I used other people's triangulation software to make lowpoly images for my backgrounds.

This wasn't a great idea for two reasons: they are still and make static screens like menus pretty boring, and I was using other people's work to do something I could feasibly do myself, learning a lot in the process.

This was definitely the most challenging project on this page to make, because the gradient coloring was done from scratch. I'll make sure to make some documentation detailing the different functions used, as well as a "make your own" section, because I made the gradient function very versatile.
